# DecoyNinja: The Decoy Submission Generator

A super dope tool I created, that takes the number of assignments and experiments you want to decoy as the input, and then outputs .PDF files that are all unique in file size and the combination of bytes in them; so no two files will ever be of the same size or byte combination, *ever*. These generated .PDFs will always show as corrupted/damaged. If the generated .PDFs are opened using the Notepad (or any other text editor) by a smarter person than the average lot, the content within each file shall be found to be consistent with that of a typical corrupted/damaged file's attributes; ideal for online submissions without any *actual* submission material. This project was created in Python.

**Dependencies to "pip install" before being able to run the Python file:**

**colorama** (for colors)

**termcolor** (for colors)
